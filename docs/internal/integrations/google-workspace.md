# Google Drive Integration

Connect your Google Drive to agentic sessions so Claude can read and write files in your Drive.

## What It Does

Once connected, Claude can:
- List files and folders in your Google Drive
- Read file contents
- Create new files
- Update existing files
- Search your Drive

## How to Use

### 1. Connect Google Drive to a Session

1. Open or create an agentic session
2. In the left sidebar, expand **"MCP Integrations"**
3. Check the status badge next to Google Workspace:
   - ✅ **Connected**: Ready to use (valid authentication)
   - 🔄 **Needs Refresh**: Token expired, will auto-refresh on next use (no action needed)
   - ⚠️ **Not Connected**: Need to authorize
4. If not connected, click **"Connect"** on the Google Drive card
5. Authorize in the popup window
6. Close the popup when you see "Authorization Successful"

**Note**: If you see "Needs Refresh", you don't need to reconnect - the MCP server will automatically refresh your token when you use Google Drive features.

### 2. Use Drive in Your Prompts

Once connected, you can ask Claude things like:

- "List the files in my Google Drive"
- "Read the contents of 'meeting-notes.txt' from my Drive"
- "Create a new document in my Drive called 'project-summary.md' with this content..."
- "Find all PDFs in my Drive from last month"

### 3. Disconnect (Optional)

Credentials are automatically removed when the session ends. To disconnect earlier, click "Disconnect" in the MCP Integrations accordion.

## First-Time Setup (Admin)

Administrators need to configure Google OAuth credentials once:

1. Create a Google Cloud project and OAuth 2.0 credentials
2. Set authorized redirect URI to: `https://your-ambient-api-server/oauth2callback`
3. Create a Kubernetes Secret in the `ambient-code` namespace:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic google-workflow-app-secret \
  -n ambient-code \
  --from-literal=GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID='your-client-id' \
  --from-literal=GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET='your-client-secret' \
  --from-literal=OAUTH_STATE_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

**Required Fields:**
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`: OAuth 2.0 client ID from Google Cloud Console
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`: OAuth 2.0 client secret from Google Cloud Console
- `OAUTH_STATE_SECRET`: Random secret for CSRF protection (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)

4. Restart the backend to pick up the new credentials:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment ambient-api-server -n ambient-code
```

## Security & Privacy

- **Session-scoped**: Credentials only exist for the current session
- **Automatic cleanup**: Credentials deleted when session ends
- **No sharing**: Your credentials never accessible to other users or sessions
- **You control access**: You must explicitly connect for each session

## Troubleshooting

**"Connect" button doesn't work**
- Check that popup blockers aren't blocking the OAuth window

**Claude says it can't access Drive**
- Verify you see "Connected" or "Needs Refresh" status in MCP Integrations accordion
- If status is "Needs Refresh", the token will auto-refresh on first use - try your request again
- If status is "Not Connected", click "Connect" to authorize
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting
- Check the session logs for errors

**"Placeholder email" or "credentials use placeholder email" error**
- Admin setup is incomplete - OAuth credentials in the Kubernetes Secret are using example values (user@example.com)
- Contact your administrator to configure real Google OAuth credentials in the `google-workflow-app-secret` Secret
- See "First-Time Setup (Admin)" section above for configuration steps

**"Invalid scopes" error**
- You may need to re-authorize with updated permissions
- Click "Disconnect" then "Connect" again
